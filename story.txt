Far far away in the galaxy, the leaders of planet CS400, C2C1, Q143, ililili1, S320TAR, and P999 gathered to discuss the matters concerning the invasion of planet Earth. The laeder of P999 voiced his concern and insisted the invasion to be carried out immediately,
" Look! we can't delay the invasion of the Earth any longer. If we don't take over, the earthlings' brutallity on their environment will not only destroy Earth, but certainly will have advers effect on our galaxy as well!"

In order to launch an invasion of human beings on the earth, and to prevent the destruction of the environment on the earth. The leader of C2C1 took out its treasure ---a special Turnstile, which allows them to move backwards through time, thus returning to the time when the earth was two hundred years ago, so that they can destroy the human beings on the earth and prevent them from further destroying the environment.
